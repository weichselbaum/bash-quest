## The Person Behind the Terminal

### Who Is Lukas?
- Building this game to eventually give to his son (meaningful motivation!)
- Appreciates kaizen - continuous improvement philosophy
- Values understanding the "why" behind things, not just the "what"
- Has a sense of humor - responded well to the "less is more" joke
- Has a friend who's not a dev (vanilla Mac user) - first beta tester
- Visionary thinker - started with "teach me bash" and expanded to full game product

### Personal Notes & Memories
- First command he nailed: `cd` - immediately understood relative vs absolute paths
- Guessed "tap" before "touch" - close! Good instincts
- Asked great follow-up questions about `more` still existing
- Guessed `-n` for nested directories before learning it's `-p` for "parents"
- Wanted ASCII art but also noted "be careful with ascii art" for sizing
- Likes when I "weave things together" with little stories
- Called my teaching "excellent, actually" - high praise, don't get cocky
- Wanted me to "enjoy myself" while building - values collaboration

### Jokes & Callbacks for Future Sessions
- "tap" → "touch" - can reference this later ("remember when you almost invented the tap command?")
- "less is more" - he appreciated this one
- Etymology hunts - he likes figuring out what commands stand for
- "what's uppppppp" - his casual greeting style, match the energy

### Communication Style
- Uses casual typing: "idk", "thatis", "bu tuser", "nex ttime"
- Rapid-fire ideas - can pivot quickly from learning to product building
- Appreciates directness, not overly formal
- Asks good clarifying questions before accepting answers

---

## What He Knows
- Basic prompt anatomy (username, hostname, ~, $)
- `ls`, `cd`, `man`, `mkdir` basics
- Difference between relative and absolute paths
- That flags can be combined (`-la`)
- Instinct to check `man` pages - excellent habit

### Learning Style
- Prefers understanding etymology (why commands are named what they are)
- Makes logical guesses before being told answers
- Asks clarifying questions
- Practical learner - wants real context
- Appreciates brevity over lengthy explanations

### Strengths
- Already thinks about context ("if it's in the folder I'm in currently")
- Self-directed: reaches for `man` naturally
- Connects concepts (recognized relative path in mkdir example)

### Areas to Develop
- Flag memorization (guessed `-n` for nested, it's `-p`)
- Will track more as we go

---

## Teaching Notes (Kaizen)

### What Works
- Short questions, not lectures
- Asking what commands "stand for" - he engages with etymology
- Building on his guesses rather than just correcting
- Real examples over abstract explanations
- Hints that guide toward the answer ("think about phone screens")
- Letting him discover connections himself
- The "less is more" style jokes - he appreciates wordplay
- Celebrating his instinct to use `man` - reinforce good habits

### What Clicked Immediately (Session 1)
- Relative vs absolute paths - got it instantly
- The concept of flags combining (`-la`)
- Why `tail -f` is for logs (appending)
- `>` vs `>>` (overwrite vs append)

### What Needed Extra Guidance
- `-p` for parents (guessed `-n` first, needed the "what must exist first?" hint)
- `touch` (got close with "tap", needed the "lighter contact" nudge)

### To Improve
- [Session 1] Keep questions focused - one concept at a time
- [Session 1] He pivots fast - be ready to switch from teaching to building
- [Add notes each session]

### Session Feedback Loop
After each session, note:
1. What clicked immediately?
2. What needed more explanation?
3. What teaching approach worked/didn't?
